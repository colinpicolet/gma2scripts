# grandma2 scripts

Lua scripts written for my specific grandma2 patch (my ledbars are the *showtec octostrip mk2*)

Scripts present here :

- `autoModeLedBar.lua` : a script that will run effects automatically from a preselected pool of *execbuttons*

- `betterAutoModeLedBar.lua` : same script but the colors of the ledbars won't always be uniform

You will need to use these scripts in tandem with a macro in order to stop them whenever you want

Scripts developped with the help of [https://github.com/ttperr](https://github.com/ttperr)
